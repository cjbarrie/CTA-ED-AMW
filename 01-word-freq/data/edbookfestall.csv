"989","book","Poetry from the Egyptian Revolution","Poems and Music in Tahrir Square","Amin Haddad","2013","<p>
	At the heart of the Egyptian revolution were the events in Tahrir Square. During the riots, Egyptian poet <strong>Amin Haddad </strong>wrote poetry which the protestors spoke or sang together for moral support and in 2011 he was awarded the Kavafis prize for poetry. Now, Amin Haddad travels to Edinburgh from Cairo with members of the revolutionary band, <strong>Eskenderella</strong>, whose musical rendering of Haddad&rsquo;s poems gave support to the protestors. They reprise &ndash; in a rare European appearance &ndash; the verse that was the immediate response to the uprising.</p>
<p>
	In 2005 Eskenderella started playing virtually underground venues in Egypt. Listening to their music &ndash; let alone composing and performing it &ndash; was an act of dissidence. They developed quickly, shifting between revivals of the nation&#39;s classic tunes and ventures into new compositions. Using collective vocals, a piano, percussion and the oud, the band started collecting a wide and passionate audience. At full strength Eskenderella consists of 14 members, several of them second and third generation artists and musicians.</p>
<p>
	During the 18-day Tahrir sit-in at the beginning of the Egyptian revolution, Eskenderella were one of the first bands to bring their instruments to the square and their music flourished with the revolution. They travelled the country to perform at public gatherings, protests, sit-ins, factories, universities and big theatrical venues. And in 2012 they performed in Gaza, the biggest concert the city had known in two decades. Even in besieged Gaza everyone knew the songs, demanded favourites, and sang along with them.</p>

Together, these four stories create a stunningly moving evocation of dialogue as it has shaped relationships across the world.</p>
<p>
	The pieces have been written by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, bestselling author of Orange Prize-winning Half of a Yellow Sun and now one of the best-known writers from Africa; Kei Miller, the acclaimed Glasgow-based Jamaican poet; Kamila Shamsie, the brilliant Pakistani-British author who was included in Granta&rsquo;s Best of Young British Novelists in 2013; and Christos Tsiolkas, the Australian author whose bestselling novel The Slap painted an entertainingly shocking picture of multicultural Australia.</p>
<p>
	Directing the theatre production are Ben Harrison, Joe Douglas, Michael John McCarthy and Alice Nelson who, with co-ordinating director Zinnie Harris, designer Becky Minto, lighting designer Colin Grenfell and composer Philip Pinsky, have transformed the writing into a spectacular promenade performance.</p>
<p>
	Please note: Letters Home is a promenade performance taking place in four venues around Charlotte Square and one venue inside Charlotte Square Gardens. Ticket holders should arrive in the Entrance Tent in Charlotte Square Gardens and will be directed from there. We will contact all bookers in July with full venue details and information on what to look for upon arrival in the Entrance Tent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Important access information:&nbsp;</strong>Three of the venues used in this production have six or seven steps to negotiate at the entrance to the building. We will have a solution that will enable access for one wheelchair user per performance; unfortunately we are unable to accommodate more than one. If you have questions or concerns regarding access, or if you use a wheelchair and would like to attend this production, please contact the box office prior to making your booking.</p>","Literature",55.951903,-3.206913,"","NA2014"

"1513","book","Letters Home","A Promenade Theatre Performance",NA,"2014","<p>
	A verbal, visual and musical journey in and around Charlotte Square Gardens. Working in partnership with multi award-winning Scottish theatre company Grid Iron, we&rsquo;ve commissioned four writers to produce brand new pieces of short fiction in the form of letters which have been adapted into a promenade theatre production. Together, these four stories create a stunningly moving evocation of dialogue as it has shaped relationships across the world.</p>
<p>
	The pieces have been written by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, bestselling author of Orange Prize-winning Half of a Yellow Sun and now one of the best-known writers from Africa; Kei Miller, the acclaimed Glasgow-based Jamaican poet; Kamila Shamsie, the brilliant Pakistani-British author who was included in Granta&rsquo;s Best of Young British Novelists in 2013; and Christos Tsiolkas, the Australian author whose bestselling novel The Slap painted an entertainingly shocking picture of multicultural Australia.</p>
<p>
	Directing the theatre production are Ben Harrison, Joe Douglas, Michael John McCarthy and Alice Nelson who, with co-ordinating director Zinnie Harris, designer Becky Minto, lighting designer Colin Grenfell and composer Philip Pinsky, have transformed the writing into a spectacular promenade performance.</p>
<p>
	Please note: Letters Home is a promenade performance taking place in four venues around Charlotte Square and one venue inside Charlotte Square Gardens. Ticket holders should arrive in the Entrance Tent in Charlotte Square Gardens and will be directed from there. We will contact all bookers in July with full venue details and information on what to look for upon arrival in the Entrance Tent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Important access information:&nbsp;</strong>Three of the venues used in this production have six or seven steps to negotiate at the entrance to the building. We will have a solution that will enable access for one wheelchair user per performance; unfortunately we are unable to accommodate more than one. If you have questions or concerns regarding access, or if you use a wheelchair and would like to attend this production, please contact the box office prior to making your booking.</p>","Literature",55.951903,-3.206913,"","NA2014"

	A verbal, visual and musical journey in and around Charlotte Square Gardens. Working in partnership with multi award-winning Scottish theatre company Grid Iron, we&rsquo;ve commissioned four writers to produce brand new pieces of short fiction in the form of letters which have been adapted into a promenade theatre production. Together, these four stories create a stunningly moving evocation of dialogue as it has shaped relationships across the world.</p>
<p>
	The pieces have been written by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, bestselling author of Orange Prize-winning Half of a Yellow Sun and now one of the best-known writers from Africa; Kei Miller, the acclaimed Glasgow-based Jamaican poet; Kamila Shamsie, the brilliant Pakistani-British author who was included in Granta&rsquo;s Best of Young British Novelists in 2013; and Christos Tsiolkas, the Australian author whose bestselling novel The Slap painted an entertainingly shocking picture of multicultural Australia.</p>
<p>
	Directing the theatre production are Ben Harrison, Joe Douglas, Michael John McCarthy and Alice Nelson who, with co-ordinating director Zinnie Harris, designer Becky Minto, lighting designer Colin Grenfell and composer Philip Pinsky, have transformed the writing into a spectacular promenade performance.</p>
<p>
	Please note: Letters Home is a promenade performance taking place in four venues around Charlotte Square and one venue inside Charlotte Square Gardens. Ticket holders should arrive in the Entrance Tent in Charlotte Square Gardens and will be directed from there. We will contact all bookers in July with full venue details and information on what to look for upon arrival in the Entrance Tent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Important access information:&nbsp;</strong>Three of the venues used in this production have six or seven steps to negotiate at the entrance to the building. We will have a solution that will enable access for one wheelchair user per performance; unfortunately we are unable to accommodate more than one.

	Directing the theatre production are Ben Harrison, Joe Douglas, Michael John McCarthy and Alice Nelson who, with co-ordinating director Zinnie Harris, designer Becky Minto, lighting designer Colin Grenfell and composer Philip Pinsky, have transformed the writing into a spectacular promenade performance.</p>

	Please note: Letters Home is a promenade performance taking place in four venues around Charlotte Square and one venue inside Charlotte Square Gardens. Ticket holders should arrive in the Entrance Tent in Charlotte Square Gardens and will be directed from there.

In this verse novel, Walker is a war veteran from Nova Scotia who sets out for Los Angeles in 1948.

	Robertson has won multiple prestigious awards for his writing and is regarded as one of Scotland&rsquo;s finest poets. He has been longlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize for <em>The Long Take</em> &ndash; about which the judges said: &lsquo;it&rsquo;s an extraordinary evocation of the debris and the ongoing destruction of war even in times of peace. Robin Robertson shows the flexibility a poet can bring to form and style.&rsquo; Come and meet a writer at the height of his powers.</p>

	Home to more than 1.2 billion people, Africa is the world&rsquo;s second most populous continent. Gaining a better understanding of this complex and diverse land, according to Ekow Eshun, rests not simply in thinking about its geography but about &lsquo;looking inwards&rsquo; to the mindsets of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>
	Eshun is a writer, curator, broadcaster and former director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London who recently curated an exhibition of contemporary photography (and a book of the same name), <em>Africa State of Mind</em>. He talks to <strong>Whitney Richardson</strong>, a former New York Times picture editor and expert on African photography, about selecting the work of over 50 artist-photographers on the continent.</p>

In the push for growth and the prioritisation of short-term economic gain, the most vulnerable communities have been left behind in policy and in practice.</p>
<p>
	We live in a world where climate disasters will increasingly coincide with human-made disasters. What hope is there for broader changes to help us achieve environmental sustainability, social equality and health?</p>
<p>
	Business leaders have argued that it will be difficult to gain support for achieving zero emissions as early as 2030 because of the huge costs. But during a global pandemic, and with urgent calls for a radical reimagining of society, is this still the case? How can we prioritise tackling the climate crisis in dire economic times, and improve the lives of the most vulnerable?</p>
<p>
	Some of the world&rsquo;s best thinkers and strategists on climate change, including&nbsp;<strong>Christiana&nbsp;Figueres</strong>, the former UN Secretary for Climate&nbsp;and&nbsp;international&nbsp;human rights lawyer <strong>Julian Aguon</strong>, join New York Times international climate reporter <strong>Somini Sengupta</strong> for a lively discussion on shaping a sustainable future with social justice at its heart.</p>

	The world is on notice. For so long we have been warned - and in turn, told our politicians - that we are running out of time. In January 2020, Booker Prize-winning writer Richard Flanagan said that Australia was &lsquo;committing climate suicide&rsquo; as horrifying fire tornadoes burnt through more than 20% of the country&rsquo;s forest.</p>
<p>
	These disasters may be &lsquo;unprecedented&rsquo; in their scale, but they are happening more often. We regularly hear of the economic impact of climate change, but what is often missed are the personal stories, dispatches about how the global environmental crisis is affecting our communities. In his new anthology <em>Tales of Two Planets</em>, writer and editor <strong>John Freeman</strong> brings together writers to tell us their personal stories of climate change and action around the world. Joining Freeman is Haitian-American writer <strong>Edwidge Danticat</strong>, Aotearoa poet <strong>Tayi Tibble </strong>and British-Malaysian photographer <strong>Ian Teh</strong> to share their stories.</p>

	While this year&rsquo;s release of <em>Breasts and Eggs</em> marks the first time Mieko Kawakami has been translated into English (by Sam Bett and David Boyd), she has been a literary sensation in Japan for more than ten years.</p>
<p>
	Her legions of fans include Haruki Murakami, who cites her as a favourite, and <em>Breasts and Eggs</em> started life as a blog attracting hundreds of thousands of readers. And it&rsquo;s not hard to see why: unapologetically feminist and gleefully subversive, this is an incisive account of three young women navigating and carving out their place in contemporary Japan.</p>
<p>
	&lsquo;The characters and stories that appear in Japanese literature tend to perpetuate Orientalist views &mdash; the idea that Japanese people are slightly odd and mysterious, but harmless,&rsquo; Kawakami said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to write anything that helps to reinforce that kind of a misunderstanding. I made an effort to depict life as it truly feels to live it in Japan.&rsquo;</p>

Before submitting the manuscript to a publisher, she says, &lsquo;I was so scared. I thought, this is the weirdest book; it doesn&rsquo;t fit any genre.&rsquo;</p>

	Nevertheless, the combination of her compelling account of training Mabel the goshawk, alongside her chronicling of the grief she felt after the death of her father, added up to one of the breakout non-fiction books of the decade.</p>

	Now she is back with <em>Vesper Flights</em>, a series of thoughtful essays about her relationship with an array of other living things. Ranging from mushrooms, glow-worms, deer and hares to falcons, swans and swifts (and even a few humans), Macdonald&rsquo;s essays exist at the intersection of nature and politics.</p>

<p>
	Radical activism has characterised much of her work &ndash; &lsquo;I could not write anything... unless it has a certain political significance. I have nothing else to offer that remains important.&rsquo; After resisting being seen as an autobiographical writer early in her career, Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s later work has drawn heavily on her childhood, her forebears and themes of gender, class and race relations in the postcolonial Caribbean and West Africa.</p>
<p>

	Soggy wellies and simmering resentments provide the backdrop to the latest novel from the scalpel-sharp Sarah Moss, who over the past decade has cemented a formidable reputation as one of Britain&rsquo;s finest, wittiest writers.</p>
<p>
	<em>Summerwater</em> takes us inside the minds of twelve ill-fated holidaymakers at a remote Scottish cabin park. Trapped indoors over the course of a typically dreich summer day, their drizzly malaise curdles into something much darker when a mother and daughter arrive, and don&rsquo;t quite fit in.</p>
<p>
	Picking at the scabs of Britain&rsquo;s fraught social contract with sly humour and characteristic elegance, Moss builds a claustrophobic portrait of a makeshift community in which people are pulled apart by a toxic mix of proximity and isolation. Who could possibly relate?

	Of the five women who died in the Autumn of 1888 at the hands of Jack the Ripper, the most salient thing that has remained in the public imagination has been the brutal manner of their murders. While the identity of the murderer has been the subject of relentless, salacious speculation, only now have the stories of those who were killed been told.</p>
<p>
	Hallie Rubenhold&rsquo;s landmark publication, <em>The Five,</em> reconstructs the lost lives of Mary Ann &#39;Polly&#39; Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly. So compelling is Rubenhold&rsquo;s book that it won last year&rsquo;s Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction.</p>
<p>
	In today&rsquo;s event, Rubenhold discusses a new essay, <em>The Problem with Great Men</em>, commissioned by Edinburgh International Book Festival as a follow-up to <em>The Five</em>, with support from Baillie Gifford and the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction. <a href=""https://www.bailliegifford.com/literature-library/miscellaneous/bg-prize-booklet-the-problem-with-great-men/"">You can download the essay here.</a></p>

	Many people are calling into question the histories handed down to us by our ancestors. With statues of so-called &lsquo;great men&rsquo; being torn down, how can we celebrate ordinary people who &ndash; like the Ripper&rsquo;s victims &ndash; have routinely been airbrushed out of history?

	A stand-alone novel, this fourth book will resonate especially powerfully with readers already familiar with <em>Autumn</em>, <em>Winter </em>or <em>Spring,</em> picking up on the intertwining experiences of several characters who appear in the earlier works.

<p>
	When Beijing passed a controversial new national security law on 30 June 2020, the party disbanded and less than a week later, two of Wong&rsquo;s books &mdash; alongside those from other pro-democracy activists &mdash; were removed from Hong Kong public libraries. &lsquo;With sweeping powers and ill-defined law,&rsquo; Wong said, &lsquo;the city will turn into a secret police state.&rsquo;</p>

	Great art doesn&rsquo;t just reinforce or reassure: the authors we love challenge us; they illuminate new perspectives, make us question our certainties. They discomfort us.</p>
<p>
	From its very title, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld&rsquo;s International Booker shortlisted debut, <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em>, does not resile from that promise. As an account of a family driven to the edge by grief, a study of where devout faith meets complicated shame, this is not like any other coming-of-age novel you&rsquo;ve read. Set on a dairy farm during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, it is visceral and corporeal, luxuriating in bodily exploration and physical debasement. &lsquo;We only knew about the harvest that came from the land, not about the things that grew inside ourselves,&rsquo; its young narrator declares.</p>
<p>
	An astonishingly raw and accomplished first novel, its 28-year-old Dutch author has hit the bestseller lists in their home country, and with Michele Hutchison&rsquo;s translation they have shared their at times brutal, at times grotesque tale even wider, drawing discomfort and accolades in equal measure.

	More than a decade in the making, Hilary Mantel&rsquo;s masterpiece is now complete with the publication of the final part of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy, <em>The Mirror and The Light.</em></p>
<p>
	As any student of 16th century England knows, Cromwell&rsquo;s life ended abruptly with his beheading in 1540. In common with <em>Wolf Hall </em>and <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em>, <em>The Mirror and The Light</em> places readers inside the head of Cromwell and it&rsquo;s no spoiler to say that Mantel&rsquo;s new book ends with the removal of that same head. But Mantel&rsquo;s novels are about so much more than one fascinating, complicated man.</p>
<p>
	In today&rsquo;s event filmed at Hilary Mantel&rsquo;s home in Devon, Guardian chief culture writer <strong>Charlotte Higgins</strong> also talks to the double Booker Prize winner about her subtle depictions of women including Anne Boleyn, and about the vivid, nuanced and compelling re-creation of a 16th century world from a 21st century perspective.

	Before most public events in Australia, there is a &lsquo;Welcome to Country&rsquo; by an Indigenous elder, or an &lsquo;Acknowledgement of Country&rsquo; by a non-Indigenous person. The &lsquo;Acknowledgment&rsquo; is a convention that speaks to an awareness of the failure of colonial Australia to reconcile the act of dispossession that defines and underpins the country to this day.</p>
<p>
	In the face of this injustice, the work and words of Indigenous writers and academics is a powerful and necessary act of resistance. <em>Fire Front: First Nations Poetry and Power Today</em> is a new anthology curated by Gomeroi poet and academic Alison Whittaker. It is, as Whittaker says in her introduction, &lsquo;fifty-three poems fuelling, making space for, depriving, reshaping, undermining and doing power in every way. What they have in common is why they do it: for the emancipation of First Nations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Join <strong>Alison Whittaker</strong> and a selection of some of the phenomenal poets who appear in the book &ndash; including <strong>Ellen van Neerven</strong>, <strong>Ancestress</strong>, <strong>Uncle Jim Everett</strong>, <strong>Meleika</strong> <strong>Gesa-Fatafehi</strong> and <strong>Declan Furber Gillick</strong> &ndash; for readings and discussions that throw down a challenge to what contributor Bruce Pascoe calls &lsquo;the tea-cosy nature of Australian comfort.&rsquo;</p>

	A leading figure in Argentine and Latin American literature, Gabriela Cabez&oacute;n C&aacute;mara is one of the most prominent feminist intellectuals of the region. Her fourth novel, <em>The Adventures of China Iron</em> is shortlisted for this year&rsquo;s International Booker Prize.</p>
<p>
	A radical retelling of the 1872 classic <em>El Gaucho Mart&iacute;n Fierro</em> by Jos&eacute; Hern&aacute;ndez, it centres the story on Fierro&rsquo;s wife, following her quest for emancipation and a new life. It&#39;s a masterpiece of formally playful, narratively expansive, tonally joyous storytelling. Flanked by her Scottish friend and companion, Liz, China&rsquo;s journey is by turns a literary subversion, a rollicking account of a road trip, a hallucinatory tour of the perils of colonisation and a critique of nationalist myth building.</p>
<p>
	Alongside her translators <strong>Fiona Mackintosh</strong> and <strong>Iona Macintyre</strong>, Cabez&oacute;n C&aacute;mara makes a welcome return to the Edinburgh International Book Festival, following her visit in 2019, to discuss the challenges and delights of reimagining a classic work of literature with fellow Argentinian novelist and writer <strong>Mariana Enriquez</strong>.</p>

	Scotland deepens its reputation for gorgeous travel writing with two delicate, touching new contributions from true masters of the form.</p>

	Highlands-based writer Kapka Kassabova may have left her Balkan motherland many moons ago, but still she feels the pull of unfinished business; one so strong that she found herself seeking answers in the small corner of the world her maternal grandmother called home. In <em>To the Lake: A Balkan Journey of War and Peace</em>, Kassabova delves into a difficult family history inextricably tied to the fading footprints by two ancient lakes that served as the hallowed meeting point of a divided region.</p>
<p>
	Back with another astonishing journey of his own, Gavin Francis presents more than a fantastic travelogue in <em>Island Dreams</em>; it&rsquo;s a paean to the influence of islands and what they represent on our minds and cultures, beacons of independence and even loneliness in an overwhelmingly connected world.</p>

	Mojave American and Latinx poet Natalie Diaz&rsquo;s <em>Postcolonial Love Poem</em> has been celebrated as a song in the face of erasure and the damage to which Indigenous people are subjected. It presents desire and pleasure as a response, perhaps the only response, to the failures of America. &lsquo;I am doing my best to not become a museum / of myself. I am doing my best to breathe in and out. // I am begging: Let me be lonely but not invisible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Mununjali Yugambeh poet Ellen van Neerven&rsquo;s experiences in Australia have followed a similar trajectory: their latest collection <em>Throat</em> is attracting acclaim as a light shone on Indigenous resilience and pride, a challenging and defiant response to the unreconciled nature of her country and its stories. &lsquo;I am not aware of my power/ you watch me build my weapon.&rsquo;</p>

	&lsquo;Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&rsquo; So said Abraham Lincoln in one of his rousing speeches, but it is a sentiment that could come straight out of the playbook of popular Dutch historian Rutger Bregman.</p>
<p>
	Bregman&#39;s compelling &lsquo;hopeful history,&rsquo; <em>Humankind</em>, is a bracingly optimistic account of human nature. Essentially, in his view, the vast majority of people are pretty decent. He contrasts this idea with biologist Frans de Waal&rsquo;s &lsquo;veneer theory&rsquo; which posits that beneath a thin skin of human decency, there&rsquo;s a savage waiting to burst forth.</p>
<p>
	Superbly readable and full of fascinating evidence, Bregman&rsquo;s book also looks at how his optimistic analysis of human nature could play out in policy terms. Hyper-local participatory democracy? Schools with little or no curriculum? A change to the tough treatment of people serving time in prisons?

	Philippe Sands&rsquo;s much celebrated memoir <em>East West Street</em>, which won the 2016 Baillie Gifford Prize,&nbsp;expertly interwove the personal story of his ancestors in the Ukrainian city of Lviv with a professional interest in the establishment of international law in the aftermath of the Holocaust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	His superb follow-up, <em>The Ratline</em>, delves further into the story of Nazi brigade leader, Otto Von W&auml;chter &ndash; a man indicted for mass murder in 1945 but who evaded capture and survived as a fugitive in the Austrian Alps for three years, before holing up in Rome under the protection of a Vatican bishop. From there he hoped to be transported along the secret &lsquo;ratline&rsquo; to Argentina &ndash; a well-known safe passage for Nazi refugees.</p>
<p>
	For this book, Sands recruited the help of Von W&auml;chter&rsquo;s youngest son, and <em>The Ratline</em> is partly about an unlikely friendship that grows between them. Above all it is a compelling, unsettling account of a search for truth, told in a style that is so vivid it feels almost like a thriller.

<p>
	In a piece for Granta, the book&rsquo;s translator Sophie Hughes reflected: &lsquo;Melchor goes with her characters to the edge of the precipice. As her English translator, I followed her there and was left changed and with many questions about her method and influences, manipulating readers, and the unavoidable lure of darkness.&rsquo;</p>

	Ahead of the Award&rsquo;s announcement, author and translator come together with poet <strong>Juana Adcock</strong> to discuss these unavoidable darknesses, and share the processes &mdash; limitations, challenges and delights &mdash; of translating such a layered, densely playful work as <em>Hurricane Season</em>. Brutal, unflinching, depraved and profane, this is a story of small towns and violence, claustrophobia and rage. Unique and unforgettable.</p>

<p>
	&lsquo;Putin is somewhat less cynical&hellip; he [believes he] is doing it for his country. Trump doesn&rsquo;t even have that delusion. It&rsquo;s all power and money in their purest form. And you could dig as deep as you want, you would never find a shred of responsibility.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
	Originally from Cameroon and raised in several countries around the continent before settling in Europe, celebrated journalist Eliza Anyangwe travels regularly across Africa, yet often finds herself confronted by that infamous question: &#39;where are you from?&#39;. Meanwhile, the language barriers faced by Lagos-born travel writer Emmanuel Iduma, author of the 2019 Ondaatje Prize longlisted <em>A Stranger&rsquo;s Pose</em>, have seen him viewed suspiciously by fellow Africans as a &#39;mute observer&#39;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Interrogating what travel writing represents for Africans on the margins, the two writers set off on an island-hopping journey from Madagascar to Comoros, finally ending up in Uganda before their trip was cut short as a result of COVID-19.

<p>
	Seeking to decode where love lies for women in modern Africa are two of its literary scene&rsquo;s most charming characters: Donna Obaseki-Ogunnaike, an Energy Law expert, poet, writer and theatre practitioner, previously dubbed the &#39;queen of spoken word poetry in Nigeria&rsquo;; and Wanjiru Koinange, a Kenyan writer, raised on a farm on the outskirts of Nairobi, whose mission to restore Nairobi&rsquo;s iconic public libraries with her social enterprise Book Bunk has received wide praise.</p>

	<em>Actress</em> is a portrait of life in the theatre, of one woman&rsquo;s rise to fame and her subsequent decline, with all the challenges that women on stage faced in the years before the #MeToo movement shone light on them.

<p>
	With echoes of early Baldwin, Paul Mendez&rsquo;s <em>Rainbow Milk</em>, one of the Observer&rsquo;s top 10 debuts of 2020, mines the author&rsquo;s upbringing as a lapsed Jehovah&#39;s Witness and, later, sex worker, to tell an intergenerational story of two men stalled at an impossible intersection of sexuality, spirituality and race.</p>

	Following her unmissable conversation with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the 2019 Edinburgh International Book Festival, we are thrilled to welcome back one of the world&rsquo;s best-respected authors to discuss her new book of essays, <em>Azadi</em>. The slogan of the struggle in Kashmir for what Kashmiris regard as the Indian occupation, &lsquo;Azadi!&rsquo; is the Urdu for &lsquo;Freedom!&rsquo;. It also became a chant on the streets of India against the project of Hindu nationalism.</p>

	In the light of the COVID-19 outbreak, freedom has, Roy says, taken on another meaning and in a new book of essays she invites us to see the pandemic as a portal between one world and another. Here, she argues, is our opportunity to imagine a better future. Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s own career as a novelist began with the extraordinary success of her Booker Prize-winning novel <em>The God of Small Things</em> in 1997.

<p>
	As a Booker Prize-shortlisted writer whose novels have been translated into over 50 languages, Shafak has risen to astonishing international recognition. Nevertheless, in her native Turkey, Shafak has also seen just how politicised a story can become: following the publication of her novel <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em> she faced legal action by the Turkish government for &lsquo;insulting Turkishness.&rsquo;</p>

	More recently, her novel <em>10 Minutes and 38 Seconds in this Strange World</em> was a tender account of the life of a Turkish prostitute. Join Shafak as she reflects on her work and ideas in a typically wide-ranging and enriching discussion.</p>

"5902","book","Yoko Ogawa & Stephen Snyder: The Memory of Forgetting","","Yoko Ogawa","2020","<p>
	Shortlisted for this year&rsquo;s International Booker Prize, Yoko Ogawa&rsquo;s <em>The Memory Police</em> is a surreal and irresistible tale of a novelist and her editor, exploring the intangible, ephemeral nature of existence and remembering.</p>
<p>
	First published in Japan in 1994 and now masterfully translated into English for the first time by Stephen Snyder, this modern classic takes place within a dystopian reality. It&rsquo;s a compelling, eerily familiar backdrop as novels are burned; innocent citizens are surveilled; people - and things - disappear. It is at once a mystery, a fable and a meditation on loss as the author in the story tries to piece together the imagined and the remembered, fragments of a past and fantasies of their creation.</p>
<p>
	As Time magazine put it: &#39;One of Japan&rsquo;s most acclaimed authors explores truth, state surveillance and individual autonomy. Echoes <em>1984</em>, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, and <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>, but it has a voice and power all its own.&#39;</p>
<p>
	Yoko&nbsp;Ogawa and Stephen&nbsp;Snyder join writer and Guardian critic <strong>Catherine Taylor</strong> to explore why a twenty-five year old vision of an imagined future remains so prescient and timely for readers today.</p>

	&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.&rsquo; Margaret Farrar, Founding Crossword Editor, The New York Times.</p>
<p>
	The world&rsquo;s first crossword puzzle was published in 1913. By 1924, Simon &amp; Schuster had capitalised on the craze, publishing the first crossword book.</p>
<p>
	A New York Times Opinion column at the time called the puzzles &lsquo;a primitive sort of mental exercise&rsquo; and a &lsquo;sinful waste&rsquo; of time, but after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, an editor made the decision to run a crossword puzzle in the paper as an antidote to blackout hours, to offer relief to its war-weary readers.</p>
<p>
	And here we are. More than 75 years later, people are still turning to The New York Times Crossword in times of crisis for comfort, stimulation and (occasionally) the competitive destruction of friends and family.</p>
<p>
	Pour yourself a drink and gather with The New York Times&rsquo;s digital crossword editor <strong>Joel Fagliano</strong> to discover in real time how a crossword is made, how the team works, and you&rsquo;ll get to take part in a live mini crossword-making session.

The commemorative event we threw for him just a few days later was among the most emotional celebrations the Festival has ever seen &ndash; a clear sign of Morgan&rsquo;s profound significance for Scottish writers and readers at the time.</p>

	In this celebration of Morgan&rsquo;s life and work we gather together some of Scotland&rsquo;s writers and poets who continue to draw inspiration from his ideas.

	For anyone feeling that the world has turned decidedly apocalyptic on us, Daniel Kehlmann&rsquo;s picaresque novel <em>Tyll</em> offers an intriguing parallel from 17th century Europe. The Thirty Years War over the Holy Roman Empire left millions of Germans dead: dark times indeed for its people.</p>
<p>
	However, for Kehlmann, <em>Tyll</em> is more than an historical novel: it is &lsquo;a literary experiment in trying to imagine what the world was like before the Enlightenment, what was it really like to live in a world before Voltaire, Newton and all these people.&rsquo; For Kehlmann&rsquo;s translator, Ross Benjamin, expressing archaic prayers, magic spells, folk ballads, pompous court etiquette and peasant speech was &#39;was the greatest challenge of the book, and the most fun.&#39;</p>
<p>
	Despite the dark subject matter and its warning signs for the present day, <em>Tyll</em> is a vivid, rip-roaring comic novel about a subversive prankster. Having sold 600,000 copies in Germany, its English edition is now shortlisted for the International Booker Prize.

	One of a rising generation of talented Argentine writers, Selva Almada burst onto the English-language book scene last year with the publication of <em>The Wind that Lays Waste</em>, a short but highly-charged novel that won the Book Festival&rsquo;s 2019 First Book Award.</p>
<p>
	She returns with a searing, devastating hybrid book which could be described as journalistic fiction or fictional journalism. <em>Dead Girls</em> reimagines the lives of three real-life small-town teenagers who were murdered in the 1980s &ndash; young women who in many ways were not dissimilar to Almada herself. Their murderers were never brought to justice and the killings were routinely dismissed by locals due to the girls&rsquo;s impoverished, working-class backgrounds.</p>
<p>
	Since then, countless femicides &ndash; as well as an increase in violence towards LGBTIQA+ people &ndash; have come to light not only in Latin America but across the world. Almada&rsquo;s unforgettable, necessary book is not only hard-hitting, it is a plangent call to action.

This, according to Dalrymple, was aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business.

	<em>The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree</em> is an incandescent novel that intertwines Persian history and folklore with magical realism, to tell the story of one family in the decade following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It is a celebration of life and imagination in the face of chaos and brutality, as well as a lyrical response to curbs on freedom of expression.

	In emotionless language full of detail, the soldier explains how the patrol unit encounters a group of Bedouin nomads and shoots them dead.

	At least, that&rsquo;s how things seem to Michel, the naive teenage comrade at the centre Alain Mabanckou&rsquo;s new fictionalised retelling of this historical moment. <em>The Death of Comrade President</em> sees Mabanckou back on the fruitful terrain of his 2015 International Man Booker contender, <em>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll Be Twenty</em>, offering up another philosophical, fleetingly absurdist portrait of the Congo&rsquo;s postcolonial transition.</p>
<p>
	The luminary Mabanckou&nbsp;talks to award-winning writer, critic and cultural journalist <strong>Maya Jaggi</strong>, reflecting on the highs and lows of a career spanning four decades, and his enduring ability to boil the sweeping grand narratives of African history into exuberant, mischievous family dramas.</p>

	&lsquo;You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words&rsquo; &mdash; so goes the epochal statement from Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, standing before world leaders at the United Nations last year. With a recent report showing only three EU countries on track to meet their commitments under the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, it can be hard to dispute her diagnosis.</p>
<p>
	Why, then, do Christiana Figueres, the former UN Secretary for Climate, and Tom Rivett-Carnac, a senior political lobbyist for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, both architects of that very agreement, find themselves feeling optimistic?</p>
<p>
	Casting ahead to our 2050 deadline, their manifesto <em>The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis</em>, sketches out two stark paths for humanity: one in which we fail to act urgently to achieve carbon neutrality, the other of cautious hope, where a shift in consciousness reignites feelings of global citizenship. With next year&rsquo;s COP26 in Glasgow standing as a make or break moment in the fight against ecological collapse, Figueres and Rivett-Carnac talk to New York Times international climate reporter S<strong>omini Sengupta</strong> about the practical ways we can empower ourselves to choose the path of survival &mdash; and not a moment too soon.</p>

	As America seemingly implodes its way toward the 2020 election, pundits and political classes continue to try to understand how the Land of the Free has found itself in such disarray. And &mdash; as it has throughout Western democracies &mdash; the conversation inevitably turns to shifting facets of identity politics.</p>
<p>
	Conversations around race and gender have moved in significant, seismic ways in recent times, and the roles played by class and education remain widely understood. But Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson&rsquo;s major new work argues that there&rsquo;s another factor controlling American society; one with far-reaching and profound effects.</p>
<p>
	She has turned her celebrated journalistic eye to what she describes as the unspoken system of power and control that underpins American society: caste. In this insightful event chaired by Pakistani writer <strong>Fatima Bhutto,</strong> Wilkerson answers your questions on how this unforgettable reframing of what divides Americans might impact their future.</p>

	While the Summer of Love is about to unfold across the Atlantic, life in 1967 isn&rsquo;t so easy for a young would-be musician in London&rsquo;s shabby Charing Cross Road. Yet from this modest starting point, David Mitchell builds a joyful fictional biography of a band that will take the world by storm. Utopia Avenue is the finest prog-folk band you have never heard of, and the novel of the same name is a stylish romp through the rags-to-riches lives of drummer Griff, singer Elf, guitarist Jasper and bass player Dean.</p>
<p>
	Organised around the song titles of the band&rsquo;s albums, <em>Utopia Avenue&#39;s</em>&nbsp;clever structure also gives it a powerful narrative drive &ndash; with added zest from a series of cheeky cameo appearances by real-life rock legends including David Bowie and Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>
	Funny, whip-smart and occasionally veering into the fantastical, it is one of the most compellingly entertaining reads of 2020. Join Mitchell as he shares his notes with folk musician <strong>Sam Amidon</strong>, who also plays some of his most recent music.</p>

	James McGonigal, Edwin Morgan&rsquo;s friend and biographer notes that the man &lsquo;was a poet of inventive forms and many voices &ndash; a writer of the unexpected. Here are two more surprises. Firstly, he actually made money from poetry. This took much effort and ingenuity, as well as an extraordinary talent. Secondly, and far-sightedly, he gave it all away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	When Edwin Morgan died in 2010, it was widely publicised that he had bequeathed almost one million pounds for the Scottish National Party&rsquo;s bid for independence. However, what was often left out of the story was the extraordinarily generous matching of this bequest to young poets, securing them some freedom for the time to write.</p>
<p>
	Edwin Morgan was a man who cared deeply about the future. The Edwin Morgan Poetry Award is given every second year to a poet aged 30 and under.

	Gender non-conforming and sexually diverse people are oppressed, persecuted and erased all over the world. The cultural concepts used to justify this &mdash; religious or secular, traditional or imported &mdash; are various, as are the histories that got us here. But wherever we live in the world and whatever version of patriarchy we live under, the damage done is universal. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	So in this traumatic global context, how does an LGBTIQA+ Arab end up making public art? What are the specific challenges and priorities for these queer artists with Arab heritage, and how do creativity and activism interweave in their work?</p>

	&nbsp;<br />
	Ullmann&rsquo;s protagonist filters through old tape recordings made alongside her late father &mdash; relics of an abandoned book project &mdash; in a grief-stricken effort to build a narrative of her formative years that she can finally make peace with. The parallels towards Ullmann&rsquo;s parentage &mdash; she is the only daughter of screen icons Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman &mdash; are plain to see.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Described as &quot;a pure tour de force&quot; by Ali Smith, Unquiet has spent more than a year on top of the Scandinavian bestseller lists.
