# Exercise 2: Sentiment analysis

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to summarize, aggregate, and analyze text in R:

* How to use dictionary-based techniques to analyze text
* How to use common sentiment dictionaries
* How to build domain-specific dictionaries

## Setup 

The hands-on exercise for this week uses dictionary-based methods for filtering and scoring words. Dictionary-based methods use pre-generated lexicons, which are no more than list of words with associated scores or variables measuring the valence of a particular word. In this sense, the exercise is not unlike our analysis of Edinburgh Book Festival event descriptions. Here, we were filtering descriptions based on the presence or absence of a word related to women or gender. We can understand this approach as a particularly simple type of "dictionary-based" method. Here, our "dictionary" or "lexicon" contained just a few words related to gender. 

In this exercise we'll be using another new dataset. The data were sourced from a series of webpages on the Internet Archive that host material collected at the Arab Spring protests in Egypt in 2011. The original website can be seen [here](https://www.tahrirdocuments.org/) and below.

For full details of the technique used to scrape these webpages, see [here](https://raw.githack.com/cjbarrie/RDL-Ed/main/03-screenscrape-apis/03-week7.html).

##  Load data and packages 

Before proceeding, we'll load the remaining packages we will need for this tutorial.

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, ggplot2, and others
library(ggthemes) # includes a set of themes to make your visualizations look nice!
library(readr) # more informative and easy way to import data
library(stringr) # to handle text elements
library(tidytext) # includes set of functions useful for manipulating text

```

We can download the final dataset with:

```{r}
pamphdata <- read_csv("data/pamphlets_formatted_gsheets.csv")
```

You can also view the formatted output of this scraping exercise, alongside images of the documents in question, in Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rg2VTV6uuknpu6u-L5n7kvQ2cQ6e6Js7IHp7CaSKe90/edit?usp=sharing).

If you're working on this document from your own computer ("locally") you can download the Tahrir documents data in the following way:

```{r, eval = F}
pamphdata <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjbarrie/RDL-Ed/main/03-screenscrape-apis/data/pamphlets_formatted_gsheets.csv")
```

## Inspect and filter data 

Let's have a look at the data:

```{r}
head(pamphdata)
```

Each document here is a pamphlet produced during the Arab Spring protests in Egypt in 2011. They have all been translated into English. The contents of each pamphlet are stored under the column entitled "text." This is the text with which we will be performing our analyses. Note also that each document has a particular date. We can therefore use these to look at any over time changes.

We manipulate the data into tidy format again, unnesting each token (here: words) from the pamphlet text. 

```{r}
tidy_pamph <- pamphdata %>% 
  mutate(desc = tolower(text)) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, desc) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "[a-z]"))
```

We'll then tidy this further, as in the previous example, by removing stop words:

```{r}
tidy_pamph <- tidy_pamph %>%
    filter(!word %in% stop_words$word)
```

Then we can check what words we are left with that appear with most frequency in the cleaned data. We see that, as expected, we have lots of words relating to "revolution," "people," "demands" etc.:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tidy_pamph %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

## Get sentiment dictionaries

Several sentiment dictionaries come bundled with the <tt>tidytext</tt> packaged. These are:

* `AFINN` from [Finn Ã…rup Nielsen](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010),
* `bing` from [Bing Liu and collaborators](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), and
* `nrc` from [Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm)

We can have a look at some of these to see how the relevant dictionaries are stored. 

```{r}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

```{r}
get_sentiments("bing")
```

```{r}
get_sentiments("nrc")
```

What do we see here. First, the `AFINN` lexicon gives words a score from -5 to +5, where more negative scores indicate more negative sentiment and more positive scores indicate more positive sentiment.  The `nrc` lexicon opts for a binary classification: positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust, with each word given a score of 1/0 for each of these sentiments. In other words, for the `nrc` lexicon, words appear multiple times if they enclose more than one such emotion (see, e.g., "abandon" above). The `bing` lexicon is most minimal, classifying words simply into binary "positive" or "negative" categories. 

Let's see how we might filter the texts by selecting a dictionary, or subset of a dictionary, and using `inner_join()` to then filter out pamphlet data. We might, for example, be interested in joy words. Maybe, we might hypothesize, there is a uptick of joy toward the beginning of the revolutionary uprising, which then subsequently declined. First, let's have a look at the words in our pamphlet data that the `nrc` lexicon codes as joy-related words.

```{r}

nrc_joy <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "joy")

tidy_pamph %>%
  inner_join(nrc_joy) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

```


```{r}
#order and format date
tidy_pamph<- tidy_pamph %>%
  arrange(date)

tidy_pamph$order <- 1:nrow(tidy_pamph)

#get tweet sentiment by date
pamph_sentiment <- tidy_pamph %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  count(date, index = order %/% 1000, sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

pamph_sentiment %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, joy)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method= loess, alpha=0.25)

```

We have a total of 336 words with some joy valence in our pamphlet data according to the `nrc` classification. Several seem reasonable (e.g., "freedom," "victory"); others seems less so (e.g., "god," "ministry").
